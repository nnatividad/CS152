========================================

[Home Page - Phase3 Code Generation](https://cs152-ucr-gupta.github.io/website/phase3_code_generator.html)


## Tools preparation

Make sure you have a Linux environment for this project. You can use 'bolt', your own Linux machine, or Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL). We highly recommend you directly use 'bolt' since it contains all the necessary tools preinstalled. 

```sh
ssh <your-net-id>@bolt.cs.ucr.edu
```

Make sure you have the following tools installed and check the version:
1. flex -V       (>=2.5)
2. bison -V      (>=3.0)
3. git --version (>=1.8)
4. make -v       (>=3.8)
5. gcc -v        (>=4.8)
6. g++ -v        (>=4.8)

## Project Submission 

* Start Date:  8/22/2023
* Due Date:    8/31/2023

Submit your project on Elearn. If you are doing the project in a group of two, each group member should submit the project separately. 

## Academic integrity

Copying source code from students in previous semester and other teams will be considered a violation of academic integrity.
